The aim of this project is to make a web app that takes in recipe data.

The app then adds this data to a datastore and displays a dynamic list of current
datastore recipes.

*Needs more work:
- unit test each feature
- style page further
  -> streamline recipe photo and name horizontally
- make list entries links to a new page that shows info about selected recipe
- add rating system to recipes
